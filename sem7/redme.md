To create a calculator for working with irrational and complex numbers in Python using OOP and SOLID principles, you would need to do the following:

1. Create a class for representing irrational numbers, and another for representing complex numbers.
2. Implement mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for both classes.
3. Implement a menu class that allows the user to select which operation they would like to perform and on which type of numbers (irrational or complex).
4. Follow SOLID principles such as single responsibility, open-closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, and dependency inversion to ensure that your code is maintainable, extensible, and easy to understand.
5. Additionally, it could be useful to implement input validation to ensure that the user is entering valid numbers, and error handling to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the program.
